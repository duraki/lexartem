## lexartem
This is repository for `lexartem`, a single source of different open-source
projects that I'm willing to present in different matter. I built **lexartem**
to visualise and show complexity, or rather, simplicty of famous open-source
projects.

The system or the program converts and translate source code of the given
project, and create a matching vectors to support a ddd project visualisation.

Project will use forked sources from [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3/) examples.

## Projects

### Symfony Framework
Symfony is a PHP-based web-application framework that is quite beautiful to use
and scale. It is one of the most videly used PHP framework alongside with
Laravel.

### Linux Kernel
Don't ask. I love C and it's aspect so presenting this will be quite awesome.
For C, I'd like to pick various values from headers and includes and possibly
make some kind of connection. Structure of code would also look awesome since
the project is huge.
