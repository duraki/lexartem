## lexartem
This is repository for `lexartem`, a single source of different open-source
projects that I'm willing to present in different matter. I built **lexartem**
to visualise and show complexity, or rather, simplicty of famous open-source
projects.

The system or the program converts and translate source code of the given
project, and create a matching vectors to support a ddd project visualisation.

Project will use forked sources from [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3/) examples.

## Projects

Symfony is a PHP-based web-application framework that is quite beautiful to use
and scale. It is one of the most videly used PHP framework alongside with
Laravel.
